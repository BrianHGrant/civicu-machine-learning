# Good Science

As bots get better and better at mimicing "social proof" on social media, it's becoming more and more important that we know how to think for ourselves. We need to recognize bad science and make sure that any pronouncements we make are grounded in logic and statistics.

## "Lies, damned lies, and statistics" -- Mark Twain

Even though these charts are not technically lying to us, we should be careful before using these techniques (or if we see someone else using them) because they may mislead the reader.

- bar charts sorted by size (imply correlation)
- a nonlinear vertical axis (understates large changes)
- a nonzero origin (understates large numbers)
- not labeling the units (see what you want to see)
- not labeling the quantity on an axis (see what you want to see)
- normalization (exagerate variation)
- pie charts (understate variation)

So, when possible, plot data for others in a way that they are used to seeing the data.  Google around to find plots of similar data to make sure your view of the data is among the common/conventional views of it. If you ever do need to do something different, innovative with your plots, make sure to include a lot of explanatory text. Every creative new chart or infographic in [Wired Magazine](http://wired.com) or [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) or the NY Times, for instance, is surrounded by a whole article explaining it.
