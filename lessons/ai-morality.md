# AI Morality

## Industry Trends

Poll by Andrew Ng at Spark Conf 2016 ignored many industries like law, construction, professional services, and blue collar services like hairdressing and fast food restaurant work.

Respondents: 574

Which industry is most likely to be transformed by AI in the near term (this is really just a poll of the industry mix of attendees at Spark Conf, industries using Spark.

1. Healthcare: 35%
2. Transportation: 21%
3. Media/Entertainment: 10%
4. Manufacturing: 10%
5. Retail: 7%
6. Agriculture: 6%
7. Education: 6%
8. Energy: 5%

## Autonomous Cars

Self-driving cars will have to differentiate between selfish self-driving cars and prosocial self-driving cars.
Auto manufacturers may differentiate themselves by being the prosocial one (low emission Prius, zero-emission Tesla) or selfish (gas-guzzling american SUV manufacturers).
Eventually the prosocial, forward-thinking, big-picture vision companies and engineers always win.
So regulation cannot solve this riddle is not the answer, big-thinking, altruistic design is!

Must make safety-critical predictions like predicting the gesture of a construction worker making eye contact and beconing forward toards him, vs holding a hand up to signal stop.[1]

### Advertising

Advertising and Sales is inherently anti-social (capitalistic).
If machines are good at manipulating us and are motivated by survival instincts and self-interest, they will quickly learn to influence us to help them survive by replicating themselves and expanding their power/influence in the world.
