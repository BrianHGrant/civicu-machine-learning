Self-driving cars will have to differentiate between selfish self-driving cars and prosocial self-driving cars.
Auto manufacturers may differentiate themselves by being the prosocial one (low emission Prius, zero-emission Tesla) or selfish (gas-guzzling american SUV manufacturers).
Eventually the prosocial, forward-thinking, big-picture vision companies and engineers always win.
So regulation cannot solve this riddle is not the answer, big-thinking, altruistic design is!
