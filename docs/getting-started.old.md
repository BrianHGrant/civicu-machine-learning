# Getting Started

## What is Machine Learning?

- Artificial Intelligence?
- Modeling (Regression)?
- Prediction?
- Statistics?
- Data Science?
- [Setting up your environment](install.md)

Communication (transmitting info)
Visualization (conveying knowledge to a human mind)

Useful to get a feel for where machine learning works and how well it works... The state of the art.

## It's All Around Us

Machine Learning snuck up on us and is now a part of nearly everything we do. Children spend most of their waking hours looking at a computer screen of some sort. Adults spend a little less time, but still much of their lives. Those screens are windows into a variety of machine learning systems.

Brainstorm with students about ml in their lives
- did they ride public transport, use Google maps, wayze, or Evans ridereport app
- did they use their phone
  - login, wifi, autocomplete
interact with any websites?
  - purchases
  - analytics
  - advertisements
- Spam filter
- Spelling corrector
- Fraud detection
- Recruiting (reading resumes and matching to job openings)
- writing poetry
- generating visual art (painting)
- recognizing cats v dogs
- recognizing individual faces
- video captcha to verify face photos
- password security/randomness estimate ?
- banjo predictions of world events from twitter
  - only have to be a ms faster
  - beating associated press and CNN by hours
- chess
- jeopardy
- deep mind atari video games (breakout expert in 4 hr)
- go (enumerated all boards)
- cpap machines
- prosthetics
- radiology doctor bots
  - mri
  - ekg
- authentication: logging onto your computer, b am account
  - ekg
  - fingerprint
- Starbucks customer RF id
  - preference profiling
- home automation

## Hack Oregon Applications

### Campaign Finance

If you had the financial transaction records for all Oregon:

- campaigns
- PACs
- candidates
- campaign managers

- money spent
- money received
- size of donors
- business location
  - donors
  - recipients
  - vendors
- home addresses
  - donors
  - recipients
  - vendors
- stated puposes/causes
- political party

What would you do with it?

What could you predict?

- election outcomes
- donor relationships
- money flow

What data would you need to train the model?
What would you need to make use of it?
What if transaction data was delayed by 1 month?
What if transactions were "laundered"?

### Agriculture

If you had access to the agricultural harvest data for Oregon:


- crop (Barley, Blackberries, Walnuts)
- county (jurisdiction)
- location
- acreage
- type of soil
- climate/weather
- water usage?

What would you do with it?
What could you predict?

- harvest during a drought?
- harvest during boom/glut (perfect weather)?

### Hunger

What would you do if you had

### Education



## Motivation

If you have somehow avoided it today, I'm going to inject some ml. Answer a poll for me so i can learn which lectures worked well and which didn't. Get andrew at harv.is to sponsor us?
Bots are already our companions. We are already cyborgs. So get to know your partner or you may lose control over your life to those pulling the puppet strings of the bots. Train them like you'd train your pet dog, or lizard

## [Install Your Tools](install.md)

Learning vs teaching
   Feature engineering
Representation vs modeling
   Master Algorithm

## Regression

- Linear Regression
- Nonlinear Regression
- Multivariate Regression

Resources
- https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning/blob/master/README.md
- that ml resource website i wrote review on?


What about wisdom of the crowds? Can't we humans work together to be smart than machines?

How many human logic fallacies are listed on wikipedia?
