# Getting Started

First lets find out if you're in the right class ;)

## What is Machine Learning?

- Artificial Intelligence?
- Modeling (Regression)?
- Prediction?
- Statistics?
- Data Science?

In some ways, machine learning is automated data science.  
But you can't automate all of Data Science.  
Machine's need a lot of help from humans.  
In future sessions we'll learn about [generative models](0X-NLP-generative-models.md) and genetic algorithms for developing software and writing code.  
But these systems are a long way from taking our jobs as Data Scientists and Machine Assistants.  
It takes human understanding to build a system(otherwise you wouldn't be here).  
And it requires a lot of effort to [get data ready](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/data-science-inconvenient-truth.html) for machine learning.

So maybe Machine Learning is:

> What a software developer would do if she were given a data science problem.

A Machine Learning expert is:

> Someone that knows more statistics than a developer and more computer science than a statistician"

## Data Science

"A statistician in Silicon Valley"

- You're going to learn statistics if you are a python developer
- You're going to learn python and data if you already know stats
- You're going to to know a lot about everything when we're done

## Data Science

Data Science is just using data to create representations or abstractions of data.  
Often these representations are useful for performing prediction. Predicting the future is what humans spend their lives learning how to do. It's why children perform "experiments" by pushing their food of the table and onto the floor. They are testing their "hypothesis" that a caregiver will put it back on the table or clean up the mess. They are also testing their hypothesis that the food won't just disappear, or transform into something different (like icecream), or become unedible.

Just like a child, machines have to perform experiments  repeatedly with the same starting conditions (inputs) and also with a large variety of inputs, before they'll get "bored" and be certain that they know how to predict the future for new examples.

But one thing that humans learn how to do (in young adulthood) that machines are still very bad at is inferring general concepts from only one or two examples. This is an area of active research. Keep this in mind when you are asked to apply machine learning to a new problem. During this course you will get a feel for where current machine learning technology works well and where it does not, this is "the state of the art." So when you try to push the limits, you'll know when to get creative or when to reuse someone else's approach.

## Machine Intelligence is Everywhere

Machine Learning snuck up on us and is now a part of nearly everything we do. Children spend most of their waking hours looking at a computer screen of some sort. Adults spend a little less time, but still much of their lives. Those screens are windows into a variety of machine learning systems.

Brainstorm with students about ml in their lives
- did they ride public transport, use Google maps, wayze, or Evans ridereport app
- did they use their phone
  - login, wifi, autocomplete
interact with any websites?
  - purchases
  - analytics
  - advertisements
- Spam filter
- Spelling corrector
- Fraud detection
- Recruiting (reading resumes and matching to job openings)
- writing poetry
- generating visual art (painting)
- recognizing cats v dogs
- recognizing individual faces
- video captcha to verify face photos
- password security/randomness estimate ?
- banjo predictions of world events from twitter
  - only have to be a ms faster
  - beating associated press and CNN by hours
- chess
- jeopardy
- deep mind atari video games (breakout expert in 4 hr)
- go (enumerated all boards)
- cpap machines
- prosthetics
- radiology doctor bots
  - mri
  - ekg
- authentication: logging onto your computer, b am account
  - ekg
  - fingerprint
- Starbucks customer RF id
  - preference profiling
- home automation

## Compression

Surprisingly, many researchers in Machine Intelligence spend a lot of time creating new and better compression algorithms. Why would this be?

How is Machine Learning like ...

- Communication (transmitting information)
- Visualization (conveying knowledge to a human)

Later in this course you'll learn why. Once you've mastered the basics and can perform regression and classification several different ways, we'll talk about information theory, channel capacity, complexity, entropy, and intelligence metrics.
